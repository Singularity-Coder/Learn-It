    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="perm_title_post_notif">Post notifications 🔔</string>
    <string name="perm_exp_post_notif">This permission allows the app to post notifications. Without this, you will
    not see the alarm screen when an alarm rings, nor be able to dismiss it later from the notification.</string>

    <string name="perm_title_exact_alarms">Schedule Alarms ⏰</string>
    <string name="perm_expln_exact_alarms">Android versions S and above need a permission to
    schedule exact alarms. Without this, the app will not be able to schedule any alarms. </string>

    <string name="perm_title_ign_bat_optim">Ignore Battery Optimizations 🔋</string>
    <string name="perm_exp_ign_bat_optim">The Android system, by default, sets all user installed apps
    to be optimized to save battery. While this is OK for many apps, this app is an alarm clock app, and often faces trouble
    if set to optimize battery. With this enabled, the Android system can kill the app at any time and/or cancel the alarms it has set, which
    will be detrimental to the working of the app. We recommend you to whitelist this app from battery optimizations.</string>

    <string name="perm_title_notif_policy">Change \"Do Not Disturb\" settings 🙅🏻</string>
    <string name="perm_exp_notif_policy">The app allows you to set different ring volumes for each alarm.
    Before ringing the alarm, the app tries to change the volume of the system alarm stream to the volume you
    have set (and restores it to what it was initially). To change the volume, the permission
    to change Do Not Disturb settings is needed in Android Nougat and above. If not granted, the app will
    simply not set the volume before ringing the alarm.</string>

    <string name="perm_title_read_media_audio">Read audio files 🎵</string>
    <string name="perm_exp_media_audio">This permission is required if you want to
    choose an alarm sound different from the default alarm sound of your device. Allows the app to read audio and music files
    on your device.</string>

    <string name="perm_requested_twice">Seems you have already denied this permission twice.
    Android will not allow this app to create the permission request dialog again. Would you
    like to head to Settings and allow this permission?</string>
